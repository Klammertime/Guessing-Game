#Hangman with Snow: Snowed In
I created a guessing game using object-oriented JavaScript and Web Storage API. This project was originally created for JavaScript for Programmers at Foothill College and then improved using Canvas, SVG images, and responsive web design using Flexbox.

###[**~PLAY SNOWED IN ONLINE HERE~**](http://klammertime.github.io/Snowed-In/)

##Technologies Used
Object-Oriented JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas, Web Storage API (locatlStorage), Flexbox, SVG graphics 

##Game Rules
1. The goal is to guess the correct word while avoiding getting snowed in.
2. When you lose a game, the snow will increase.
3. When you win a game, the snow will decrease.
4. Incorrectly guessed letters show up under wrong letters. 

##Resources
* Free vector designs by [Vecteezy](http://www.vecteezy.com/vector-art/65953-landmark-vectors) with several edits made using Illustrator. 4 images composited using Canvas.
* **Lynda.com**: [HTML5: Graphics and Animation with Canvas - Creating Animation with Double Buffering](http://www.lynda.com/HTML-tutorials/Creating-animation-double-buffering/80782/85072-4.html) - I adapted his snow example heavily since double buffering is not necessary with requestAnimationFrame technology and overheats the CPU. I really liked how he creates drift since
snow does not fall sraight to the ground it makes it much more real looking.
