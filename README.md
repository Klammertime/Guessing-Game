##Resources
* Free vector designs by [Vecteezy](http://www.vecteezy.com/vector-art/65953-landmark-vectors) with several edits made using Illustrator. 4 images composited using Canvas.
* **Lynda.com**: [HTML5: Graphics and Animation with Canvas - Creating Animation with Double Buffering](http://www.lynda.com/HTML-tutorials/Creating-animation-double-buffering/80782/85072-4.html) - I adapted his snow example heavily since double buffering is not necessary with requestAnimationFrame technology and overheats the CPU. I really liked how he creates drift since
snow does not fall sraight to the ground it makes it much more real looking.
